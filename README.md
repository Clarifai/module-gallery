## Versioning

This library doesn't use semantic versioning. The first two version numbers (`X.Y` out of `X.Y.Z`) follow the API (backend) versioning, and
whenever the API gets updated, this library follows it.

The third version number (`Z` out of `X.Y.Z`) is used by this library for any independent releases of library-specific improvements and bug fixes.
